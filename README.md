# Multithreaded System Runner

This project is an implementation of a multi-threaded news broadcasting simulation, written in C, for an Operating Systems course. The system models the flow of data from multiple producers, through a dispatcher and co-editors, to a screen manager, emphasizing synchronization and thread-safe bounded buffers.

## Overview
The system simulates the production and handling of different types of news stories: `SPORTS`, `NEWS`, and `WEATHER`. These stories are represented as strings generated by **Producer threads**, routed and categorized by a **Dispatcher thread**, processed by **Co-Editor threads**, and finally displayed by a **Screen Manager**.

### Main Components:
- **Producers**: Generate and send messages to the dispatcher via their private bounded queues.
- **Dispatcher**: Polls each producer in round-robin, sorts messages by type, and routes them to the appropriate Co-Editor queue.
- **Co-Editors**: One per message type; simulate editing delay and forward messages to the screen manager.
- **Screen Manager**: Prints messages and gracefully shuts down after receiving all "DONE" signals.

## Features
- Dynamic system initialization from a configuration file
- Thread management (creation, joining, cleanup)
- Safe memory allocation utilities
- Configurable system behavior
- Custom thread functions
- Internal queue structure for thread communication (if applicable)

## Building the Project
Make sure you have `gcc` or another C compiler installed, then run:

```sh
make
```

This will compile the source files and generate an executable named `app`.

## Running the Program
Run the compiled executable with a configuration file as an argument:

```sh
./app config.txt
```

## Configuration
The system reads settings from `config.txt`. Ensure it contains the expected format for your application. You can define things like:
- Number of threads
- Task types
- Timing constraints

Refer to `config.h` and `config.c` for specific keys and formats supported.

## Thread System
The threading model is defined in `thread_funcs.h` and implemented in `thread_funcs.c`. Threads are created and managed via the `startThreads` and `joinThreads` functions.

## Memory Safety
The `safe_alloc.h` module wraps memory allocation functions to add checks and safety against failures.
